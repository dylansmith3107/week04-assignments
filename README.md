Reflection

Required

🎯 What requirements did you achieve?

I believe I achieved all regular requirements, creating a full functional and responsive system.

🎯 Were there any requirements or goals that you were unable to achieve?

Many of the reacher goals, I gave some of them (e.g. like button, delete button) some thought, but they felt a little beyond my current capabilities in order for them to be of a high standard

🎯 If so, what was it that you found difficult about these tasks?

Allowing different users to only delete their own posts, and to have the database remember which user has liked which post

Optional

🏹 Feel free to add any other reflections you would like to share about your submission, for example:

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission.

I would like feedback on the efficiency of my code, if there's anything I could have done to make it more automated / efficient. Also was wondering how I would go about making it so the DOM displays the entries in a database in reverse order, so newer entries appear at the top.

What useful external sources helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials)?

What errors or bugs did you encounter while completing your assignment? How did you solve them?

What went really well and what could have gone better?

I feel the general visual design could have been much better, for some reason with this specific assignment, I had some sort of artists block type thing, and was struggling to come up design ideas, and some of those I did have in mind did not come to fruition.
